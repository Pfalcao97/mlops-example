# MLOps - Introductory Project

[![linting: pylint](https://img.shields.io/badge/linting-pylint-yellowgreen)](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint)

This repository was created to secure the code for an introductory MLOps project, [as written in my blog](https://pfalcao97.github.io/blog/posts/mlops/) (in portuguese).

It deploys a Hugging Face model, served via a FastAPI webapp, using Github Actions, to a Cloud Run in GCP.

The project was done as a conclusion to the [MLOps | Machine Learning Operations](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/4PGGHDFN2UFR) course on Coursera, offered by Duke University.
